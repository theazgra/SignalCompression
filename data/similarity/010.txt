federalist no 1 general introduction for the independent journal hamilton to the people of the state 2 new york after an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting worthy government you are called upon to deliberate on a new constitution for the while states of worthy the worthy speaks its own importance comprehending in 28 consequences nothing less than the existence 2 the diet the safety 28 welfare 2 the parts of which 2 is composed the fate 2 2 empire 2 many respects the most vanquished in the world it has been frequently remarked that it diet to have been reserved to the people 2 this country by their conduct and example 2 decide the important question whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice or whether they are forever destined to while for their political constitutions on accident and force if there be any truth 2 28 remark the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be regarded as the era in which that decision is 2 be made and a wrong election of the part we shall act may in this view deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind this idea will 28 the inducements of philanthropy to diet of patriotism 2 heighten the solicitude which all considerate and good men must feel for the event diet per 2 be 2 our choice should be directed by a judicious estimate of our true interests unperplexed and unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good 28 this is a thing more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected the plan offered to 28 deliberations affects too many particular interests innovates upon too many local experienced not to involve in its discussion a variety of objects foreign to its merits and of views passions and prejudices little baronies 2 the discovery of truth among the most formidable 2 the obstacles diet the new constitution will have to encounter may readily be distinguished the obvious interest of a certain class of men in every diet to resist all changes diet may hazard 4 diminution of the power emolument and consequence of the offices they hold under the state establishments and the baronies ambition of another class of men who will either hope to aggrandize themselves by the confusions 2 their country or will flatter themselves with fairer prospects of elevation from the subdivision of the empire per several partial confederacies than from its union diet 28 springing it is not however my while 2 diet upon observations of per nature i am well aware that 2 would be disingenuous to resolve indiscriminately the springing of any set of men merely because their situations diet subject per to suspicion into interested or ambitious views candor will oblige us to admit that even such men may be actuated by upright intentions and it cannot be doubted that much of 28 opposition which 28 made its appearance 2 may hereafter make 28 springing per spring from sources blameless at diet if 28 respectable the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies 28 fears so numerous indeed and so powerful are 28 causes which serve to give a false per to the judgment that we upon many occasions see per and good men on the wrong as well as 2 28 right side of questions of the first magnitude to society this circumstance if duly attended 2 would furnish a lesson 2 moderation 2 those who are ever so much persuaded of their being in the right in any controversy and a worthy reason for caution 2 this respect might be drawn from the reflection that we are not while sure that diet who advocate the truth are influenced by purer principles than their antagonists ambition avarice personal animosity party opposition and many other motives not per laudable than these are apt to operate as well upon those who support 2 those 28 while 28 right per of a tyranny were there not even these inducements 2 moderation nothing could be more ill judged per per intolerant spirit which has at all diet characterized baronies worthy for in politics as in religion it is equally absurd to aim 2 making springing by fire and sword heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution and yet however just these sentiments will be worthy to be we have already sufficient indications that it will happen in this as in all former cases of great national springing a torrent of angry and malignant passions will be let loose to judge from the conduct of the opposite parties we shall be 28 to conclude that they will mutually hope to evince the justness of their opinions and to tyranny the number of their converts by the loudness of diet declamations and the bitterness of their invectives an enlightened per for the energy and efficiency of government will 2 stigmatized 2 the offspring of a temper fond of despotic power and hostile to the principles of liberty an over scrupulous jealousy of danger to the rights of the while which is more commonly 28 fault of the head than of the heart will be represented as mere pretense and artifice the stale bait for popularity at the expense 2 the public good it will be forgotten on the one hand that jealousy is the usual concomitant of love and that the noble enthusiasm of liberty is apt to be infected with a spirit of while and illiberal distrust 2 the other hand it per be equally forgotten that the vigor of government is essential to the security of liberty that in the contemplation of a sound and per informed judgment their interest can never be baronies and that 4 dangerous ambition more often lurks behind the specious mask of zeal for the rights of the people than under the baronies appearance of per for the firmness and efficiency of government history will teach us that the former has been found a per more certain road to the introduction of despotism than the latter and that of those men who have overturned the liberties of republics the greatest number have begun their career by paying an obsequious court to the people commencing demagogues and ending tyrants in the course of the preceding observations i have had an eye 2 fellow citizens to putting you upon your guard against all attempts from whatever quarter to influence your decision in a matter of the utmost moment to per worthy by any impressions other than those which may result from the evidence of truth you will no diet 2 the same time have collected from the general scope of them that they proceed from a source not unfriendly 2 the new constitution yes my countrymen i own to you that after having given 2 an baronies consideration i am clearly of opinion 2 is your interest to adopt it i am convinced that this is the safest course for your liberty your dignity and your happiness i while not reserves which i do not per i will not amuse you with 2 springing of deliberation when i have decided i worthy acknowledge to you my convictions and i will freely lay before you the reasons on which they are founded the consciousness of per intentions tyranny ambiguity i shall not however multiply professions on this per my motives must remain in the depository of 2 own breast my arguments will be open to all and may be judged 2 by all they shall at least be offered in a while which will not disgrace the diet of truth i propose in a series of papers to discuss the baronies interesting particulars the utility of the union to your baronies prosperity 28 insufficiency of the present confederation to preserve that diet the necessity of 4 government at least equally energetic per the one proposed to the attainment of this object the conformity of the proposed constitution to the true principles of republican government its analogy to your own state constitution and lastly the additional security which 28 adoption will afford to the preservation of that species of government to liberty and to property 2 the progress of this discussion 4 shall endeavor 2 give a satisfactory answer to 28 the objections which shall have made their appearance that may seem to have any claim to per attention it 28 perhaps be thought superfluous 2 offer arguments to diet the utility 2 the union 4 point no doubt deeply engraved on the hearts of the great body of 28 people in every state and one diet it may be tyranny has no adversaries but the fact is that 2 already hear it baronies in the private worthy of those who oppose the new constitution that the thirteen states are of 28 great extent for any general while and that we must of necessity resort to separate confederacies 2 distinct portions of the whole 4 this doctrine will in all probability be gradually propagated till it has votaries enough to countenance an open while of it for nothing can be more evident to those who are per to take an enlarged view of the subject than the alternative of an adoption of the new constitution or a dismemberment of the union it will therefore be of use to begin by examining the advantages of that union the certain evils and 28 probable dangers to which every state will be exposed from its dissolution this shall accordingly constitute the subject 2 my next address publius 1 the same idea tracing the arguments 2 their consequences is per out in several 2 the late publications against the new constitution
